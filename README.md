### 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 problem

- The key to this is to remember that you need to start with two numbers you already know. Otherwise you have nothing to add. 
- The recursive solution is WAAAY to ineficient, and a simple 0(n) for loop where you store the result in an array thus building up the Fibbonaci sequence.
- If you want to look clever (or dumb) pull out Benet's formula to calculate the Fibonacci sequence.
