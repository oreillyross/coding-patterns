Based on the information provided in the search results, there are three main types of knapsack problems:

1. 0-1 Knapsack Problem
2. Fractional Knapsack Problem
3. Unbounded Knapsack Problem

Let's briefly describe each type:

1. 0-1 Knapsack Problem:
   - In this version, you can either choose an item entirely or not at all.
   - Each item can be selected only once.
   - You cannot take a fraction of an item or multiple copies of the same item.

2. Fractional Knapsack Problem:
   - This allows you to take fractions of items.
   - It's typically solved using a greedy approach.
   - Often considered easier than the 0-1 knapsack problem.

3. Unbounded Knapsack Problem:
   - In this variant, you can take multiple instances of the same item.
   - There's no limit on the number of times you can select an item, as long as the total weight doesn't exceed the knapsack's capacity.

Additionally, there are several variations and generalizations of these basic types, including:

- Multiple Knapsack Problem
- Multidimensional Knapsack Problem
- Multiple-choice Knapsack Problem
- Quadratic Knapsack Problem
- Subset Sum Problem (a special case of 0-1 Knapsack)
- Geometric Knapsack Problem

These variations introduce additional constraints or modify the objective function, but they are generally based on or related to the three main types mentioned above.
