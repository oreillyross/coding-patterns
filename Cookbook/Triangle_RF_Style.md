Alright, let's dive into this algorithm and break it down from first principles. I'm gonna explain this as if we're sittin' in a diner, scribbling on napkins and really getting to the heart of what's goin' on here. 

Let's start with what we're tryin' to do. We've got this triangle of numbers, right? And we want to find the path from top to bottom with the smallest total. It's like we're climbin' down a mountain, always pickin' the gentler slope.

Now, let's go through this line by line:

```python
def minimum_total(triangle: List[List[int]]) -> int:
```
This is just us sayin', "Hey, we're gonna solve this triangle problem." We're promising to give back a single number - the smallest total we can find.

```python
n = len(triangle)
```
We're just countin' how many levels our triangle has. Simple stuff.

```python
@lru_cache(None)
```
Now, this is a neat trick. It's like havin' a photographic memory. Once we figure something out, we remember it. No need to do the same work twice!

```python
def dfs(i, level):
```
This is where the magic happens. We're saying, "Let's explore this triangle, startin' at position i on this level." It's like we're standin' on a ledge of the mountain, decidin' where to go next.

```python
if level == n:
    return 0
```
This is our base case. If we've reached the bottom of the triangle, we're done! No more numbers to add.

```python
best = inf
next_level = level + 1
```
We're bein' optimistic here. We start by assumin' the best path is infinitely good (which is really bad in this case, since we want the smallest sum). And we're lookin' ahead to the next level.

```python
for nexti in [i, i + 1]:
    if 0 <= nexti <= next_level:
        best = min(best, dfs(nexti, next_level))
```
This is the heart of our exploration. We're sayin', "From where I'm standin', I can go straight down or diagonally right." We check both options (as long as they're valid moves) and remember the better one.

```python
return best + triangle[level][i]
```
After explorin' all possible paths from this point, we add the number we're standin' on to the best path we found below. It's like sayin', "The best path from here is the cost of standin' here plus the best path I found goin' forward."

```python
return dfs(0, 0)
```
Finally, we kick off our exploration from the very top of the triangle.

Now, the intuition here is all about breakin' down a big problem into smaller, manageable pieces. We're using what we call "dynamic programming," but don't let the fancy name fool ya. It's just a way of sayin', "Let's solve this step by step, rememberin' what we've figured out along the way."

The key insight is that at any point in the triangle, the best path from that point down is independent of how we got there. So we can solve each subproblem once and reuse that knowledge.

It's like if you were actually climbin' down a mountain. At each point, you'd look at your options and pick the best way forward. You don't care about the path you took to get there; you just care about the best way to continue.

The `@lru_cache(None)` is our way of marking the trail. Once we've explored a path, we remember the result. If we ever find ourselves at the same spot again, we can just recall what we found last time instead of explorin' all over again.

The beauty of this approach is that it naturally handles all the different paths through the triangle without us havin' to explicitly trace each one. We're lettin' the recursion do the heavy liftin' for us.

In essence, we're breakin' down a complex problem into a series of simple decisions: "Should I go straight down or diagonally right?" By making the best choice at each step and remembering what we've learned, we can solve the whole problem efficiently.

That's the power of thinking from first principles - we've taken a complex problem and boiled it down to its essence. It's not about memorizing a specific algorithm; it's about understanding the fundamental nature of the problem and building a solution from the ground up.
